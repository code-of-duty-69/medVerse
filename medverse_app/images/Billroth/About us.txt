Billroth Hospitals was founded by the late Dr. V. Jeganathan, starting with 30 beds and expanding to 350 beds by 2007, including the acquisition of Kalliapa Hospitals. Sadly, Dr. Jeganathan passed away in 2007, and his son, Dr. Rajesh Jegannathan, took over at just 26 years old.

Under Dr. Rajeshâ€™s leadership, Billroth became a super-specialty hospital, introducing the first dual CT scan in Tamil Nadu and pioneering cancer treatments like Rapid Arc. He also launched philanthropic initiatives, providing free healthcare for the poor, while fostering a positive work environment, which has been key to the hospital's success.
